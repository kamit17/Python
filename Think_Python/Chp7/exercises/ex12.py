# Many interesting shapes can be drawn by the turtle by giving a list of pairs like we did above,
# where the first item of the pair is the angle to turn, and the second item is the distance to move forward.
# Set up a list of pairs so that the turtle draws a house with a cross through the centre, as show here.
# This should be done without going over any of the lines / edges more than once, and without lifting your pen.

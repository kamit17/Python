# Now that you’ve got a traffic light program with different turtles for each light, perhaps the visibility / 
# invisibility trick wasn’t such a great idea. If we watch traffic lights, they turn on and off — but when they’re off
#  are still there, perhaps just a darker color. Modify the program now so that the lights don’t disappear: they are 
# either on, or off. But when they’re off, they’re still visible.
